Sometimes we want to run a command (or group of commands) over and over.   
This is called iteration, repetition, or looping.   
The most commonly used shell repetition structure is the for loop

Followings are the various forms of "for loop"

for VARIABLE in 1 2 3 4 5 .. N
do
    command1
    command2
    commandN
done

#or

for VARIABLE in file1 file2 file3
do
    command1 on $VARIABLE
    command2
    commandN
done

#or

for OUTPUT in $(Linux-Command)
do
    command1 on $OUTPUT
    command2 on $OUTPUT
    commandN
done

#or
