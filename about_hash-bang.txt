The Shebang/hashbang/hash-pling is used to tell the Linux OS which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file.
The standard syntax for the hashbang is #!. We put the hash bang at the beginning of the script.
It tells the system to execute the script in mentioned interpreter.
We can use various shell interpreters that are present in the system.
Ex. bash, sh, zsh, python
Then the hash bang with various shell interpreters can be represented as -
#!/usr/bin/env or #!/bin/env

examples:
#!/usr/bin/sh
#!/usr/bin/zsh
#!/usr/bin/python
#!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/bin/bash
